Life Cycle Methods:
   1.Mounting
       when an instance of a component being created and inserted into the dom
		constructor()
		static getDerivedStateFromProps()
              render()
		componentDidMount()
   2.Updating
      when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to props or state
		static getDerivedStateFromProps()
		shouldComponentUpdate()
		render()
		getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
		ComponentDidUpdate()
   3.Unmounting
		when a component is being removed from the DOM
		componentWillUnmount()
   4.Error Handling
		when ever there is an error during rendering/in life cycle of component/constructor/child component
		static getDerivedSTateFromError()
		componentDidCatch()


Mounting Life Cycle:
--------------------------
constructor():
	1.when component is being created 
	2.It will be useful for init of state and event bindings
	3.we can directly override state by using 'this.state'

static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state):
	1.when the state of the component depends on changes in props over time
	2.It will be helpful for set the state

render():
	1.This is Required Method
	2.Read Props & state and return JSX
	3.We can also render child components

componentDidMount():
	1.Invoked immediately after a component and all its child components are rendered to the DOM
	2.If we make AJAX calls, it will gives exceptions


Updating Life Cycle Method:
-----------------------------------
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
	1.This method will be called every time when a component is re-rendered
	2.It will be useful for SetStae

shouldComponentUpdate():
	1.It dictates if the component should re-render or not
	2.Preformance optimization

render():
	1.This is Required Method
	2.Read Props & state and return JSX
	3.We can also render child components

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps,prevState):
	1.called right before the changes form Virtual DOM are beging reflected to DOM
	2.This method either return null or  a value.
	3.Returned value will be passes as the third parameter to the next method

ComponentDidUpdate(prevPros,prevState,snapshot):
	1.This method will be called after the render finished re-render


UnMounting Phase Method:
   componentWillUnmount():
	1. method is invoked imediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed
	2. removing/deleting event handlers, cancelling of subscriptions

Error Handling Phase Methods:
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
  componentDIdCatch(error,info)
